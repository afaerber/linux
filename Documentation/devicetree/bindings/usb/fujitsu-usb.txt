FUJITSU GLUE AND OTHER SPECIFIC COMPONENTS

F_USB20HDC USB DUAL-ROLE CONTROLLER
 - compatible : Should be "fujitsu,f_usb20hdc_otg"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device.
 - interrupts : The irq number of this device that is used to interrupt the
   CPU
 - dma_dreq : handle to use "fujitsu,mb8ac0300-hdmac" DMA controller.
 - hdmac_channel : handle to use "fujitsu,mb8ac0300-hdmac" DMA controller.
 - clocks: from common clock binding, handle to usb clock.
 - clock-names: from common clock binding.
 - #stream-id-cells : handle to use "arm,mmu-400" ARM IOMMU driver

MB86S7x DWC3 GLUE
 - compatible : Should be "fujitsu,mb86s70-dwc3"
 - clocks: from common clock binding, handle to usb clock.
 - clock-names: from common clock binding.
 - #address-cells, #size-cells : Must be present if the device has sub-nodes
 - ranges: the child address space are mapped 1:1 onto the parent address space
 - #stream-id-cells : handle to use "arm,mmu-400" ARM IOMMU driver

Sub-nodes:
The dwc3 core should be added as subnode to MB86S7x dwc3 glue.
- dwc3 :
   The binding details of dwc3 can be found in:
   Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/dwc3.txt
