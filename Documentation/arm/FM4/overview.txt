			FM4 ARM Linux Overview
			======================

Introduction
------------

  The Spansion FM4 family of Cortex-M4 MCUs are supported by the
  'FM4' platform of ARM Linux. Currently S6E2CC SoCs are supported, with the
  SK-FM4-176L-S6E2CC Starter Kit boards.


Configuration
-------------

  A generic configuration is provided for FM4, and can be used as the default by
	make fm4_defconfig


Layout
------

  All the files for multiple machine families are located in the platform code
  contained in arch/arm/mach-fm4

  There is a generic board machine.c in the mach folder which supports
  Flattened Device Tree, which means, it works with any compatible board with
  Device Trees.
